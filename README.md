# Hark – Hearing Aid Relay Kit

Hark is a lightweight Android app that turns your phone into a live microphone, streaming audio directly to your hearing aids using Bluetooth. Built originally to solve a personal problem, Hark replaces the need for expensive “table microphone” hardware with a single button on your phone.
